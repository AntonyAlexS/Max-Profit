# Max Profit Problem – Streamlit App

## 📌 Project Description

This project solves the **Max Profit Problem** using **Python** and **Streamlit**.

The aim is to find the best way to build properties so that the total earnings are **maximum within the given time**.

## 🧠 Problem Summary

Mr. X has limited time to build properties.  
He can build **only one property at a time**.

### Property Details

| Property            | Build Time | Earnings per Time Unit |
| ------------------- | ---------- | ---------------------- |
| Theatre (T)         | 5          | $1500                  |
| Pub (P)             | 4          | $1000                  |
| Commercial Park (C) | 10         | $2000                  |

- Only one building can be constructed at a time  
- Buildings earn money **after construction**  
- Earnings depend on remaining time  
- If multiple solutions give the same profit, **all should be shown**
